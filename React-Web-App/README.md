I built a dynamic web page with persistent storage together with Bianca Mihaela.  
The site contains a form to enter a client's personal data, a client profile where you can edit the personal
information and save them, a search bar to search a client for every personal information and a statistics page where
you can see how many clients have been added/deleted/edited or the current number of clients
